# 202506-ML-EyeTracking
This is an study on spatial reasoning ability assessment with eye tracking data, using machine learning meethod.

7/1/2025
1. Machine Learning Preparation
Successfully completed a 3-month Machine Learning course offered by Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) in collaboration with Stanford University.
Gained a comprehensive understanding of:
  Supervised learning (e.g., classification, regression)
  Unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)
  Reinforcement learning (policy/value methods, exploration-exploitation tradeoffs)
Aligned acquired ML knowledge with the goals of applying predictive and pattern recognition models to eye-tracking data for cognitive and spatial reasoning research.
Earned certification to formally validate this training.

2. Eye-Tracking Data Preparation
Successfully extracted and cleaned raw eye-tracking data from the lab's collection device for downstream analysis.
Data format standardization (fixation, saccade, and AOI metrics)
Preliminary quality check and outlier detection
Removal of incomplete trials and correction of timestamp alignment issues
Ensured data is ready for feature engineering and machine learning model development in the next research phase.
