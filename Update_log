1. Set up this repository to organize all required materials and maintain a clear, collaborative workflow.
 
2. Organized Eye-Tracking Metrics
  Extracted and reviewed 50 trial-level metrics from EyeLink exports
  Categorized them into fixation, saccade, pupil, blink, AOI, and interaction features

3. Defined Feature Dictionary
  Created data_dictionary.md documenting all variables with descriptions
  Linked this dictionary for future GitHub integration: [data_dictionary.md](./data_dictionary.md)

3. Evaluated Labeling Challenges
  Analysised limitations of subjective cognitive strategy labels (e.g., planner, explorer)
  Considered alternatives including rule-based annotation and strategy-neutral analysis, and decided to use strategy-neutral analysis (unsupervised). THe 

4. Designed Unsupervised Analysis Pipeline
  Developed a complete, strategy-neutral unsupervised pipeline using dimensionality reduction (UMAP/t-SNE) and clustering (HDBSCAN/KMeans)
  Saved the design in unsupervised_pipeline.md
  
Did a preliminary reasearch and consideration on this research diagram.

1. Machine Learning Preparation
Successfully completed a 3-month Machine Learning course offered by Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) in collaboration with Stanford University.
Gained a comprehensive understanding of:
- Supervised learning (e.g., classification, regression)
- Unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Reinforcement learning (policy/value methods, exploration-exploitation tradeoffs)
Aligned acquired ML knowledge with the goals of applying predictive and pattern recognition models to eye-tracking data for cognitive and spatial reasoning research.
Earned certification to formally validate this training.

1. Eye-Tracking Data Preparation
- Successfully extracted raw eye-tracking data from the collection device.
- Flag incomplete participant, whose trail number is not equal to 21. The flagged data is listed below:
  - ET24_068 (23), ET24_091 (23), ET24_092 (23), ET220002 (19), ET220003 (23), ET220008 (23)
  - After looking deeply, I found that these participants initially completed three test trials at the beginning of the task. These test trials were excluded from the analysis, and only participant ET220002, who completed only 19 trials in total, was subsequently removed from the dataset.

2. Preliminary quality check and outlier detection
3. Ensured data is ready for feature engineering and machine learning model development in the next research phase.
